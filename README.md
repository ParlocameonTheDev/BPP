Version 1.1.1

Hello again, we decided that some maps needed to go, mainly ones with weird layouts. These were some of my/Penial's first maps and they definently did not play well. To fill in the removal of them, I created 2 more, but expect more soonâ„¢. And as usual, we made some minor balance tweaks, and a small amonunt of bug fixes. 

Removed Map: Dominos

Removed Map: Hills

Removed Map: Labs

Removed Map: Phone

Removed Map: Table

Removed Map: Tunnel

Added Map: Flicker

Added Map: Pickle (the name was Porty's idea, it does not have anything to do with pickles sadly.)

New Card: Trusty Pan Ultra Super XL

More balancing and bug fixes, as usual.

Version 1.0.1:

Yo, I caught COVID shortly after we released the mod, and very quickly started recieving feedback. I am now feeling fine and have adjusted many things. There are no new cards or maps, but I have fixed many bugs and made various balance tweaks. I also want to thank Willuwontu for the information about card stats and for their pull requests.

Removed Card: Avid Venter

Removed Card: Big Bang

Removed Card: Intervention

Removed Card: Nuclear

Removed Card: Trusty Pan

Balanced almost every card to be more in-line with other popular packs and vanilla cards, it's not in the best state but it's much better now.
