Version 1.0.1:

Yo, I caught COVID shortly after we released the mod, and very quickly started recieving feedback. I am now feeling fine and have adjusted many things. There are no new cards or maps, but I have fixed many bugs and made various balance tweaks. I also want to thank Willuwontu for the information about card stats and for their pull requests.

Removed Card: Avid Venter

Removed Card: Big Bang

Removed Card: Intervention

Removed Card: Nuclear

Removed Card: Trusty Pan

Balanced almost every card to be more in-line with other popular packs and vanilla cards, it's not in the best state but it's much better now.
